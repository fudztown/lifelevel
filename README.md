The Life Level Project

This project is an idea thought up by Pete Town and Howard Penning over a coffee.

This idea is simple: to have a place were a person can track their life goals and achivements and compare them to others
and share their successes. 

It's split into 2 key areas.

Achievements: A fix set of goals that are defined and proved by sharing photos and videos.

Challenges: A particular set of rules are definded and them over a time period people will attempt to be the best at the 
            Challenge. If they are the win then gains the trophy for that challenge.
